### ü§∑ What is VPN ?

A Virtual Private Network (VPN) allows users to send and receive data through shared or public networks as if their computing devices were directly connected to the private network. Thus, applications running on an end-system (PC, smartphone, etc.) over a VPN may benefit from individual network features, protection, and management. Encryption is a standard aspect of a VPN connection but not an intrinsic one.

### üì∂ What is WireGuard‚ùì

WireGuard is a straightforward yet fast and modern VPN that utilizes state-of-the-art cryptography. It aims to be faster, simpler, leaner, and more useful than IPsec while avoiding the massive headache. It intends to be considerably more performant than OpenVPN. WireGuard is designed as a general-purpose VPN for running on embedded interfaces and super computers alike, fit for many circumstances. Initially released for the Linux kernel, it is now cross-platform (Windows, macOS, BSD, iOS, Android) and widely deployable. It is currently under a massive development, but it already might be regarded as the most secure, most comfortable to use, and the simplest VPN solution in the industry.

### üí° Options

- `PRIVATE_SUBNET_V4_SETTINGS` - Specifies the private IPv4 subnet to be used within the VPN. The default is `10.0.0.0/8`, which is a standard private IP range.
- `PRIVATE_SUBNET_V6_SETTINGS` - Defines the private IPv6 subnet. The default `fd00:00:00::0/8` is a typical private IPv6 range.
- `SERVER_HOST_V4_SETTINGS` - This setting is for detecting the public IPv4 address of the server, commonly used for establishing connections from outside the local network.
- `SERVER_HOST_V6_SETTINGS` - Similar to the IPv4 setting, but for detecting the server's public IPv6 address.
- `SERVER_PUB_NIC_SETTINGS` - Determines the local public network interface using the `ip` command. This is essential for the server to communicate on the public network.
- `SERVER_PORT_SETTINGS` - Specifies the default public port (`51820`) for the WireGuard interface. This is the port through which VPN traffic will pass.
- `NAT_CHOICE_SETTINGS` - Configures whether or not to use the VPN tunnel's keep-alive feature, which helps maintain the connection active.
- `MTU_CHOICE_SETTINGS` - Sets the Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) for WireGuard peers. This value impacts the size of packets transmitted over the network.
- `SERVER_HOST_SETTINGS` - This might be a general setting for defining server-specific configurations, but it's not clear without more context.
- `CLIENT_ALLOWED_IP_SETTINGS` - Defines the IP range allowed for clients connecting to the VPN. This can restrict which devices can connect.
- `AUTOMATIC_UPDATES_SETTINGS` - Likely relates to whether the system will automatically update software or configurations.

### ü§ù Code Development

**Effortlessly Develop Code Without Cloning the Repository**

You can work on the code directly without the need to clone the entire repository. This is made possible through Visual Studio Code's online platform. By clicking the link below, you can preview and edit the code in your browser, utilizing the user-friendly interface of Visual Studio Code. This approach simplifies the development process, especially for those who want to make quick changes or don't wish to set up the entire repository on their local machine.

[![Open in Visual Studio Code](https://img.shields.io/badge/preview%20in-vscode.dev-blue)](https://open.vscode.dev/complexorganizations/wireguard-manager)

### üêõ Code Debugging

**Step-by-Step Debugging Process After Cloning the Repository**

For a more in-depth debugging process, you may prefer to clone the repository to your local system. This approach allows you to thoroughly test and debug the code in your environment. Follow these steps to clone the repository and initiate the debugging process:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Use the Git command to clone the repository to your preferred directory, such as `/root/` in this example. This step copies all the code from the online repository to your local machine.

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/complexorganizations/wireguard-manager /root/
```

2. **Begin Debugging**: After cloning, navigate to the script's directory and start the debugging process. The script will be executed in debug mode, providing detailed output of each step. This output is redirected to a log file for easier examination. The log file, located in the same directory, stores all the debugging information, making it simple to trace any issues or understand the script's behavior.

```bash
  bash -x /root/wireguard-manager/wireguard-manager.sh >>/root/wireguard-manager/wireguard-manager.log
```

By following these steps, you can either quickly modify the code online without cloning or perform a more thorough debugging process by cloning the repository to your local machine. Each method offers different advantages depending on your needs and the scope of your work with the WireGuard Manager script.

Certainly! Improving the debugging process for a broad range of developers involves ensuring the steps are clear, accessible, and cover various scenarios and tools that developers might use. Here‚Äôs an expanded and more detailed guide to enhance the debugging experience:

     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/complexorganizations/wireguard-manager /path/to/local-directory
     ```
   - **Choose an Appropriate Directory**: Avoid using root directories for development. Choose a user directory to ensure safety and manage permissions easily.

3. **Familiarize with the Codebase**

   - **Code Review**: Before diving into debugging, take time to understand the code structure, coding conventions, and documentation provided.
   - **Utilize Documentation**: Check the repository for a README file or wiki pages that may offer insights into the codebase.

4. **Set Up Debugging Tools**

   - **Configure Your IDE**: Use the debugging tools available in your IDE. Set breakpoints, watch variables, and use step-through debugging features.
   - **Logging**: Make sure logging is set up correctly in the script to capture sufficient details for debugging.

5. **Run the Script in Debug Mode**

   - **Execute with Bash Debugging Enabled**: Run the script with `bash -x` to get detailed trace outputs.
     ```bash
     bash -x /path/to/local-directory/wireguard-manager/wireguard-manager.sh >> /path/to/local-directory/wireguard-manager.log
     ```
   - **Monitor the Log File**: Regularly review the log file for errors or unexpected behavior.

6. **Test in Different Environments**

   - **Use Virtual Machines or Containers**: Test the script in isolated environments like Docker containers or VMs to understand how it behaves in different settings.
   - **Cross-Platform Testing**: If possible, test on different operating systems to ensure compatibility.

7. **Collaborate and Seek Feedback**

   - **Use Version Control Smartly**: Commit changes to a new branch and use pull requests for reviews.
   - **Code Reviews**: Request code reviews from peers to get different perspectives on potential issues.

8. **Document Your Findings**

   - **Update Documentation**: If you find undocumented behavior or fixes, update the project documentation.
   - **Report Issues**: Use the repository's issue tracker to report bugs or suggest enhancements.

9. **Automate Testing**

   - **Write Test Cases**: Create automated tests for critical functionalities to catch bugs early.
   - **Continuous Integration**: Use CI tools to automate testing with every commit or pull request.

10. **Stay Updated with the Repository**
    - **Pull Regular Updates**: Regularly update your local repository with changes from the main project to stay in sync and avoid conflicts.

By following these steps and adapting them to their own development environment and workflow, developers can more effectively debug and contribute to the WireGuard Manager project. This comprehensive approach caters to various skill levels and preferences, thereby facilitating a more inclusive and efficient development process.
